## Masters-Thesis-Crown-Tuning
This repository holds the R scripts I used to generate the results from my master's thesis and the [resulting publication](https://www.mdpi.com/619942).

At the heart of each script is the [lidR package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lidR/lidR.pdf)

This [wiki](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/lidR/wiki) is a great place to start learning about the lidR package.
